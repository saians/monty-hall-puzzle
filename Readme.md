# Simulation of Monty Hall problem
This solution shows the probability puzzle of Monty Hall game. 

## Assumption

The number of boxes are bounded to 3.
When one box is selected by the player out of 3 boxes the probability is 1/3. \
As the host opens a box which is empty and this box is removed so the probability becomes 2/3 \
which shows that if player switches the box there is more chance to win the game.

## Running the solution

Build it by running mvn package in the terminal. \
Set numberOfSimulations in GameApp. \
Run GameApp and follow the console for results. \
You can also run the test in GameTest which case gives more winning probability.
